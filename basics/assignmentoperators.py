# Assignment Operators in Python

# Assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable
a = 125
print('a =', a)  # Output: a = 125

# Addition assignment operator (+=)
a += 10  # a = a + 10
print('New value =', a)  # Output: New value = 135

# Subtraction assignment operator (-=)
a -= 10  # a = a - 10
print('New value =', a)  # Output: New value = 125

# Multiplication assignment operator (*=)
a *= 10  # a = a * 10
print('New value =', a)  # Output: New value = 1250

# Division assignment operator (/=)
a /= 10  # a = a / 10
print('New value =', a)  # Output: New value = 125.0

# Floor Division assignment operator (//=)
a //= 3  # a = a // 3
print('New value =', a)  # Output: New value = 41.0

# Modulus assignment operator (%=)
a %= 3  # a = a % 3
print('New value =', a)  # Output: New value = 2.0

# Exponentiation assignment operator (**=)
a **= 10  # a = a^10
print('New value =', a)  # Output: New value = 1024.0

# Multiple assignments in a single line
a = b = c = 10
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 10 10 10
